V0.4 (17, May 2009)
  - From now to use D3D8 with GMAPI You have to define GMAPI_USE_D3D, "GMAPI_NO_D3D" has been removed
  - GMVARIABLE structure: renamed to GMVALUE, added << operator overload with std::ostream, member names changed
  - New GMVARIABLE structure (it turned out that the previous GMVARIABLE structure represents, in fact, GM's value format - that's why i've renamed above-mentioned structure)
  - CGMVariable: New ctor that takes GMVALUE ref in parameter
  - New methods in CGMAPI class: GetSymbolID, GetLocalVariablePtr, GetGlobalVariablePtr, GetInstancePtr, GetCurrentInstancePtr, GetCurrentInstanceID, SetCurrentInstance, EnumInstances & With. (+ other, unimportant :))
  - Small fixes in GMAPICore\main.asm (+ new GMFindSymbolID function)
  - MessageBox calls changed to MessageBoxA (projects with UNICODE character set could'nt be compiled)
  - Prefixes of pointer type definitions in GmapiDefs has been changed from "LP" to "P" (e.g. LPGMSPRITE >>> PGMSPRITE)
  - Several small fixes in comments
